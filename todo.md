# TODO

1. Compute point that lies at the end of the vector between the center point and
   the curve in the middle of the pizza slice. Going to need to compute the
   angle of the pizza slice.
2. Finish the "isInside()" logic. Missing the angle check.
3. Determine if we need to use the global polygon.
4. Implement the secondary call to the pizza slice iterator such that the input
   is the angle (orientation), center, and radius.
5. Finish the demo code to make sure that the iterator works.
